Just a simple project for my experiments with knockout.js, require.js and some other things (maybe another language for the backend).
The Backend will be developed in Perl. Maybe I port it in some other language/framework, which is interesting for me too.

This is just a learning project for my own! I repeat, do not expect anything useful!
